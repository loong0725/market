## 1. Background

### 1.1 Institutional Context

The Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), established in 1959, is a leading international postgraduate institution located in Pathum Thani, Thailand (www.ait.ac.th). AIT hosts a diverse international student community representing over 40 countries, with the majority residing on campus throughout their academic programs. The institution offers programs in engineering, technology, management, and environmental studies, attracting students who typically stay for 1-2 years for master's degrees or 3-4 years for doctoral programs.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Throughout their academic journey, AIT students face several significant challenges related to acquiring and managing personal belongings:

**1.2.1 Disposal Challenges for Graduating Students**
Graduating or departing students frequently struggle with disposing of usable items such as furniture, electronics, study materials, and household appliances. These items, while still functional, often end up discarded due to lack of convenient disposal channels, contributing to environmental waste.

**1.2.2 High Initial Costs for New Students**
Incoming students face substantial financial burdens when acquiring essential living items. Purchasing new furniture, appliances, textbooks, and daily necessities in a single transaction creates significant economic pressure, particularly for international students managing currency exchange and limited budgets.

**1.2.3 Language and Cultural Barriers**
International students encounter difficulties accessing local second-hand markets due to language barriers and unfamiliarity with local trading practices. This limitation restricts their ability to find affordable alternatives to new purchases.

**1.2.4 Sustainability Concerns**
The current system results in unnecessary waste generation, as usable items are discarded rather than reused. This contradicts AIT's commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, which is a core value of the institution.

**1.2.5 Lack of Centralized Trading Platform**
Existing solutions rely on informal channels such as social media groups, WhatsApp messaging, and word-of-mouth, which lack structure, security, and discoverability. There is no dedicated platform that facilitates safe, organized trading within the AIT community.

### 1.3 Market Opportunity

Research indicates that second-hand C2C e-commerce platforms have experienced significant growth, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic (Wang & Sun, 2023). Studies on consumer behavior in online marketplaces reveal that trust and security are critical factors influencing platform adoption (Rachbini et al., 2019). Campus-based marketplaces have demonstrated success in creating secure trading environments for student communities, addressing the unique needs of university populations (Ismail et al., 2020; Jafri et al., 2025). The AIT marketplace addresses a clear market need within a well-defined, captive audience of approximately 2,000+ students, faculty, and staff members, leveraging the benefits of a closed, trusted community environment.

## 5. E-Business Model and Revenue Model

### 5.1 E-Business Model Classification

The AIT Marketplace operates as a **Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) E-Marketplace** with platform intermediary characteristics. This model is well-established in the e-commerce literature and has proven successful for second-hand goods trading (Wang & Sun, 2023). Research on e-business models in online marketplaces indicates that product innovation, infrastructure management, and customer relationship management significantly influence customer purchasing decisions (Karlina et al., 2019). The platform's design incorporates these elements to create value for both buyers and sellers within the AIT community.

**5.1.1 Platform Model Characteristics**

- **Network Effects**: Value increases with more users and listings
- **Community Governance**: Platform rules and moderation ensure quality

**13.4.4 Integrated Messaging and Communication System**

The platform implements a comprehensive private messaging system that facilitates secure, direct communication between buyers and sellers within the AIT community. This system addresses a critical requirement for C2C marketplaces, as research indicates that effective communication channels significantly enhance trust and transaction completion rates in peer-to-peer trading platforms (Rachbini et al., 2019).

**13.4.4.1 System Architecture and Data Model**

The messaging system is built upon a relational database model that ensures data integrity and efficient querying. The core Message model implements the following structure:

- **Sender and Receiver Relationships**: Each message maintains ForeignKey relationships to the User model, establishing clear sender-receiver pairs. The model uses `related_name` attributes (`messages_sent` and `messages_received`) to enable efficient bidirectional querying of user message histories.

- **Item Association**: Messages can be optionally associated with specific items through a nullable ForeignKey to the Item model. This association enables contextual communication, allowing users to discuss specific listings directly from item detail pages. The relationship uses `on_delete=models.SET_NULL` to preserve message history even if items are deleted, maintaining communication records for dispute resolution and historical reference.

- **Message Content and Metadata**: The text field stores message content as a TextField, supporting messages of variable length. Timestamps are automatically managed through `auto_now_add=True`, ensuring accurate chronological ordering. The model's Meta class specifies ordering by `-created_at`, enabling efficient retrieval of recent messages first.

**13.4.4.2 Privacy and Security Implementation**

The messaging system implements robust privacy controls to ensure that communications remain confidential between participants:

- **Query-Level Privacy**: The `MessageViewSet` class overrides the `get_queryset()` method to implement strict access control. The queryset filters messages using a logical OR operation (`|`) that returns only messages where the authenticated user is either the sender or receiver: `Message.objects.filter(sender=user) | Message.objects.filter(receiver=user)`. This ensures that users can only access their own conversations, preventing unauthorized access to other users' private communications.

- **Authentication Requirements**: All messaging endpoints require authentication through JWT tokens, enforced by `permissions.IsAuthenticated` in the permission classes. This prevents anonymous access and ensures that only verified AIT community members can participate in messaging.

- **Automatic Sender Assignment**: The `perform_create()` method automatically assigns the authenticated user as the message sender, preventing users from impersonating others or sending messages on behalf of other accounts. This security measure is critical for maintaining trust in the platform.

- **Read-Only Field Protection**: The serializer designates the `sender` field as read-only, preventing clients from manipulating sender information through API requests. This ensures data integrity and prevents potential security vulnerabilities.

**13.4.4.3 Frontend Implementation and User Experience**

The frontend messaging interface is implemented as a sophisticated React component that provides an intuitive, conversation-based user experience:

- **Conversation Grouping Algorithm**: The system implements a client-side algorithm that groups individual messages into conversations based on user pairs. The `groupMessagesIntoConversations()` function processes the message array, identifying unique user pairs and organizing messages chronologically within each conversation. This approach enables efficient conversation management without requiring additional database queries or server-side processing.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The messaging interface implements automatic refresh functionality, polling the API every 10 seconds to retrieve new messages. This approach provides near-real-time communication while maintaining compatibility with the RESTful API architecture. The polling interval balances responsiveness with server load considerations.

- **Conversation List Interface**: The left panel displays a scrollable list of all user conversations, sorted by the timestamp of the most recent message. Each conversation entry displays the other participant's username, a preview of the last message, and the timestamp, enabling users to quickly identify and access relevant conversations.

- **Message Thread Display**: The right panel presents the selected conversation's message history in a chronological, chat-bubble format. Messages are visually distinguished based on sender identity, with different styling for messages sent by the current user versus received messages. This visual distinction enhances readability and provides clear context for the conversation flow.

- **Item Context Integration**: When messages are associated with specific items, the interface displays a link to the related item, enabling users to quickly reference the item under discussion. This contextual integration streamlines the negotiation process and reduces friction in transaction completion.

- **Message Composition Interface**: The message input area provides a text field with keyboard support for Enter key submission, enabling efficient message composition. The interface includes loading states and error handling to provide feedback during message transmission.

**13.4.4.4 Integration with Item Detail Pages**

The messaging system is seamlessly integrated into the item listing workflow, enabling direct communication initiation from product pages:

- **Contact Seller Functionality**: Item detail pages include a "Contact Seller" button that opens a modal dialog for message composition. This integration eliminates the need for users to navigate away from the item page to initiate communication, reducing friction in the buyer-seller interaction process.

- **Automatic Item Association**: When messages are sent from item detail pages, the system automatically associates the message with the specific item, creating a contextual link between the communication and the listing. This association enables sellers to understand which item a buyer is inquiring about, even when managing multiple listings.

- **Navigation Flow**: After sending a message from an item page, users are automatically redirected to the messaging interface, where they can continue the conversation and view their message history. This flow ensures continuity in the communication process.

**13.4.4.5 API Design and Endpoints**

The messaging system exposes RESTful API endpoints following Django REST Framework conventions:

- **Message List Endpoint** (`GET /api/chat/messages/`): Retrieves all messages for the authenticated user, filtered to include only conversations where the user is a participant. The endpoint supports pagination for users with extensive message histories.

- **Message Creation Endpoint** (`POST /api/chat/messages/`): Accepts message creation requests with receiver ID, optional item ID, and message text. The endpoint validates input data, automatically assigns the sender, and persists the message to the database.

- **Message Retrieval Endpoint** (`GET /api/chat/messages/{id}/`): Enables retrieval of individual messages by ID, subject to privacy constraints ensuring the authenticated user is a participant in the conversation.

**13.4.4.6 Data Serialization and Response Format**

The `MessageSerializer` class handles data transformation between database models and API responses:

- **Read-Only Computed Fields**: The serializer includes `sender_username` and `receiver_username` as read-only fields, automatically populated from the related User objects. This design eliminates the need for additional API calls to retrieve user information, improving performance and reducing client-side complexity.

- **Field Selection**: The serializer exposes only necessary fields (id, sender, sender_username, receiver, receiver_username, item, text, created_at), following the principle of least privilege and reducing unnecessary data transfer.

**13.4.4.7 User Interface Design and Accessibility**

The messaging interface implements responsive design principles and accessibility considerations:

- **Responsive Layout**: The interface uses a two-column layout on desktop devices (conversation list and message thread) that adapts to a single-column mobile layout, ensuring usability across device types.

- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, error messages, and success confirmations provide clear feedback to users about system status and action outcomes.

- **Internationalization Support**: All user-facing text in the messaging interface is internationalized, supporting English, Chinese, and Thai languages through the platform's translation system.

**13.4.4.8 Performance Considerations**

The messaging system implements several performance optimizations:

- **Efficient Querying**: The queryset filtering uses database-level filtering, leveraging database indexes for optimal query performance. The use of ForeignKey relationships enables efficient JOIN operations.

- **Client-Side Processing**: Conversation grouping and sorting are performed client-side, reducing server load and enabling responsive user interactions without additional API calls.

- **Pagination Support**: The API supports pagination for message retrieval, enabling efficient handling of users with extensive message histories.

**13.4.4.9 Future Enhancement Opportunities**

The current messaging implementation provides a foundation for future enhancements:

- **Real-Time WebSocket Integration**: The system architecture supports migration to WebSocket-based real-time communication using Django Channels, which would eliminate polling overhead and provide true real-time messaging.

- **Read Receipt Functionality**: The data model can be extended to include read status tracking, enabling users to see when their messages have been read.

- **Message Search and Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities within message history would enhance usability for users with extensive conversation histories.

- **File and Image Attachments**: The system can be extended to support file and image sharing within messages, enabling users to share additional context during negotiations.

- **Push Notifications**: Integration with browser push notification APIs would alert users to new messages even when not actively using the platform.

This comprehensive messaging system enhances the platform's functionality by facilitating direct communication between users, thereby supporting transaction completion, trust building, and community engagement within the AIT marketplace ecosystem.
